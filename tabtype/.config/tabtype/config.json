      "expand" : "## Focus Areas\n\n### 1. Code Organization & Modularity\n- Extract cohesive modules: Identify logical groupings of functionality that can be separated into focused modules\n- Split large files: Break down files with multiple responsibilities into single-responsibility modules\n- Reduce coupling: Identify and minimize tight dependencies between components\n- Improve cohesion: Ensure related functionality stays together\n\n### 2. API Design & Interface Clarity\n- Simplify public interfaces: Reduce API surface area where appropriate\n- Consolidate related endpoints: Group similar functionality under coherent modules\n- Improve naming: Ensure functions, classes, and modules have clear, intention-revealing names\n- Establish clear boundaries: Define explicit interfaces between subsystems\n\n### 3. Code Reuse & Shared Utilities\n- Extract common patterns: Identify repeated code blocks and extract shared utilities\n- Create helper functions: Abstract repetitive operations into reusable helpers\n- Avoid duplication: Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle judiciously\n- Consider creating common libraries: For widely-used functionality across the codebase\n\n### 4. Code Hygiene\n- Remove dead code: Delete unused functions, classes, and variables\n- Eliminate obsolete tests: Remove tests for deleted functionality\n- Clean up commented code: Remove commented-out code blocks that are no longer relevant\n- Update stale documentation: Align comments and docs with current implementation\n\n## Design Patterns to Consider\nWhen refactoring, consider applying these patterns where appropriate:\n- Factory Pattern: For complex object creation logic\n- Strategy Pattern: For interchangeable algorithms or behaviors\n- Facade Pattern: To simplify complex subsystem interfaces\n- Repository Pattern: For data access abstraction\n- Dependency Injection: To reduce coupling and improve testability\n- Builder Pattern: For constructing complex objects step-by-step\n- Adapter Pattern: To integrate incompatible interfaces\n\n## Anti-Patterns to Avoid\nBe mindful of over-engineering by avoiding:\n- Premature abstraction: Don't create protocols\/interfaces used in only one place without clear future need\n- Speculative generality: Don't add flexibility \"just in case\" without concrete requirements\n- Excessive layering: Don't create layers of indirection that obscure rather than clarify\n- Over-modularization: Don't split code so finely that it becomes hard to follow the flow\n- Abstract base classes for single implementations: Wait until you have 2-3 implementations before abstracting\n- Configuration over convention: Prefer sensible defaults over requiring configuration\n- Framework creation: Resist building internal frameworks unless you have multiple consumers\n\n## Success Criteria\nQuality is not measured by lines of code, but by:\n- Readability: Can a new developer understand the code flow quickly?\n- Maintainability: Can changes be made safely without cascading effects?\n- Testability: Can components be tested in isolation?\n- Clear responsibility: Does each module have a well-defined, focused purpose?\n- Appropriate abstraction levels: Are abstractions justified by actual reuse or flexibility needs?\n- Minimal cognitive load: Does the architecture reduce mental overhead for understanding the system?\n\n## Approach\n- Analyze before acting: Understand the current structure and dependencies first\n- Identify pain points: Look for actual problems, not theoretical ones\n- Prioritize high-impact changes: Focus on areas that will yield the most benefit\n- Refactor incrementally: Make changes in small, testable steps\n- Preserve behavior: Ensure functionality remains unchanged unless explicitly intended\n- Validate with tests: Confirm existing tests pass after refactoring\n\n## Guiding Principles\n- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Only add what's needed now\n- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple solutions over clever ones\n- Rule of Three: Consider abstracting after the third duplication, not the first\n- Single Responsibility: Each module should have one reason to change\n- Open\/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification (where it makes sense)",
